This private Kaggle competition was hosted by Leonardo Labs: https://www.leonardo.com/en/innovation-technology/leonardo-labs.
In this competition we had to classify 7 different classes of marine ships:

0. battleships
1. coast-guard
2. containerships
3. cruise-ships
4. drilling-rigs
5. motor-yachts
6. submarines

We trained an Artificial Neural Network to carry out a multiclass image classification task. We obtained an accuracy ~95%. The code we developed is in the *KaggleCompetitionFinal.ipynb* file, the training and testing images are in the associated folder. The results obtained can be found in the file submission.csv where are reported the names of the images tested and the predicted class number.
