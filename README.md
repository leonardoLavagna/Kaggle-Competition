This private Kaggle competition was hosted by Leonardo Labs: https://www.leonardo.com/en/innovation-technology/leonardo-labs
In this competition we had to classify 7 different classes of marine ships:

1. battleships
2. coast-guard
3. containerships
4. cruise-ships
5. drilling-rigs
6. motor-yachts
7 submarines

We trained an Artificial Neural Network to carry out a multiclass image classification task. We obtained an accuracy ~95%. The code we developed is in the *KaggleCompetitionFinal.ipynb* file, the training and testing images are in the associated folder.
